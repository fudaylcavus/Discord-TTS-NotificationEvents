https://github.com/Metalloriff/BetterDiscordPlugins/blob/master/VoiceChatNotifications.plugin.js

then i just added a few line to make it speech notification

Last Update Changes (23/10/2018) :
- Added Option for choose Notification type (Play, Display). You can use both

If discord not remember your settings, open console (CTRL + Shift + I), then paste 
' NeatoLib.hasRequiredLibVersion({ getName: () => {} }, "999.999.999") '.
It will fix it.
